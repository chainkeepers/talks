Annotation:

Even during the bear market quite a few new L1s appeared promising increased speed.  In the talk, I'll present the most notable ones deserving attention: Sei and Sui, and  compare those to a traditional one Solana.  Once done, you'll have an idea about what affects time to finality, how fast can state be propagated on those blockchains and which of the new ones might actually be doing something really new.
